\usage{
step_pretrained_text_embedding(
  recipe,
  ...,
  role = "predictor",
  trained = FALSE,
  handle,
  args = NULL,
  skip = FALSE,
  id = recipes::rand_id("pretrained_text_embedding")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the
sequence of operations for this recipe.}

\item{...}{One or more selector functions to choose variables.}

\item{role}{Role for the created variables}

\item{trained}{A logical to indicate if the quantities for
preprocessing have been estimated.}

\item{handle}{the Module handle to resolve.}

\item{args}{other arguments passed to [hub_load()].}

\item{skip}{A logical. Should the step be skipped when the
recipe is baked by [recipes::bake.recipe()]? While all operations are baked
when [recipes::prep.recipe()] is run, some operations may not be able to be
conducted on new data (e.g. processing the outcome variable(s)).
Care should be taken when using `skip = TRUE` as it may affect
the computations for subsequent operations}

\item{id}{A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.}
}
\description{
`step_pretrained_text_embedding` creates a *specification* of a
 recipe step that will transform text data into its numerical
 transformation based on a pretrained model.
